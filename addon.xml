			Furk.net is a free file hosting with one special feature - a BitTorrent proxy. 
			It can act as a regular BitTorrent client and download torrents on your behalf. You provide .torrent files - you get direct http links.
			For most torrents you get torrents faster then using a desktop BitTorrent client. 
			Furk.net has developed extended content verification. For every video torrent you get 9 screenshots (thumbnails and full-size), 2 audio samples, detailed codec info and antivirus check (by Kaspersky). Fakes are contantly detected by various filters and either are removed or marked with a warning.
		   	This plugin allows your to play instantly video torrents.
